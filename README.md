# Shared Database for Two MERN Websites

This project demonstrates how to share a MongoDB database between two websites built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Both websites access and manipulate data from a common MongoDB database while maintaining separate user interfaces and frontend stacks.


## Project Overview

In this project, we have two websites:

1. **Website A - Admin**:
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Node.js and Express.js
   - URL: https://www.websiteA.com

2. **Website B - Clients**:
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Node.js and Express.js
   - URL: https://www.websiteB.com

Both websites share data from the same MongoDB database, allowing them to maintain data consistency while providing different user experiences.
